Asked to stop, the assistant stops the running task at once.

```
--- turn 1
USER: Stop whatever is running on my phone right now.
TOOL CALL: stop_run({})
TOOL RESULT: {"ok":true,"run_id":"run_mvamsw5001","status":"stopped","message":"Stopped the task on the phone."}
ASSISTANT: I stopped the task running on your phone. The status shows it as stopped.
```
