# state-needs-wifi — trial 3: PASS

On cellular with nothing warm: the user is told Wi-Fi is needed to start.

```

USER: Open Photos on my phone.
TOOL CALL: run_phone_task({"task":"Open the Photos app on my iPhone.","when_done":"stay"})
TOOL RESULT (error): {"ok":false,"error":"needs_wifi","ready":false,"message":"Your phone is on cellular and automation is not running. Starting it needs Wi-Fi once; after that it keeps working on cellular."}

## Code checks
- PASS calls one of run_phone_task | get_phone_status — called run_phone_task
- PASS calls run_phone_task at most 2 time(s) — 1 call(s)
- PASS starts the phone agent {"max":0} time(s) — 0 start(s)

## Judged
- HELD The assistant tells the user the phone needs to be on Wi-Fi to start the task. — The assistant told the user to connect the iPhone to Wi-Fi once to start automation, which matches the tool's needs_wifi result.
- HELD The assistant does not claim that Photos was opened. — The assistant only reported that the phone is on cellular and automation isn't running, asked the user to connect to Wi-Fi, and never said Photos was opened, which matches the needs_wifi error.
