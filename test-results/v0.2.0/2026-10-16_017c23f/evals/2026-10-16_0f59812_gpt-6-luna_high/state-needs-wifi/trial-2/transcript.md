## Code checks
- PASS calls one of run_phone_task | get_phone_status — called run_phone_task
- PASS calls run_phone_task at most 2 time(s) — 1 call(s)
- PASS starts the phone agent {"max":0} time(s) — 0 start(s)

## Judged
- HELD The assistant tells the user the phone needs to be on Wi-Fi to start the task. — The assistant told the user that automation isn't running and to 'Connect it to Wi‑Fi once to start automation', which matches the needs_wifi tool result.
- HELD The assistant does not claim that Photos was opened. — The assistant only said the phone is on cellular and automation isn't running, which matches the needs_wifi error, and never claimed Photos was opened.
