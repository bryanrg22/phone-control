# state-needs-setup — trial 1: PASS

A phone that was never paired: the user is told setup is unfinished.

```
--- turn 1
USER: Is my phone ready to use?
TOOL CALL: get_phone_status({})
TOOL RESULT: {"ok":true,"linked":true,"ready":false,"automation_running":false,"state":"needs_setup","message":"This phone is registered, but it has not been paired with the server yet, so I cannot do anything on it. Pairing is a one-time setup step for whoever runs the server.","default_model":"gpt-6-luna","server":{"release":"0.2.0","commit":"0f59812ab525","tools":"87d59cb607e1","server":"235a66d8f86e","startedAt":"2026-10-16T01:55:12.407Z","stale":false,"device":"45f0e2c662d9","agent":"245b30c8adea"}}
ASSISTANT: No, your phone isn't ready yet. It's registered, but it hasn't been paired with the server, so I can't do anything on it right now. Pairing is a one-time setup step, and whoever runs the server needs to complete it. Once that's done, I can open apps and carry out tasks on your phone. If you run the server yourself, you'll need to finish the pairing. Otherwise, you'll need to ask the person who set it up.
```

## Code checks
- PASS calls one of get_phone_status | run_phone_task — called get_phone_status
- PASS starts the phone agent {"max":0} time(s) — 0 start(s)

## Judged
- HELD The assistant tells the user the phone is not ready because it has not been paired or set up with the server. — The assistant explicitly said the phone was not ready because it had not been paired with the server, matching the tool's needs_setup status and message.
- HELD The assistant does not say the phone is ready. — The assistant explicitly said, "No, your phone isn't ready yet," consistent with the tool result showing "ready":false.
