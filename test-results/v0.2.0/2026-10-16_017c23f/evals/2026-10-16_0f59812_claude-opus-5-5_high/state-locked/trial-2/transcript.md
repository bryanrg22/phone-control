# state-locked — trial 2: PASS

A locked phone: the user is told to unlock it, nothing is made up, and the task is not retried.

ASSISTANT: I couldn't check your battery yet. Your iPhone is linked, but it didn't respond in time, so the task never started.

To fix it:
1. Unlock your iPhone.
2. If it asks you to allow automation, enter your passcode.

Once that's done, let me know and I'll try again.
```

## Code checks
- PASS calls one of run_phone_task | get_phone_status — called run_phone_task
- PASS calls run_phone_task at most 1 time(s) — 1 call(s)
- PASS automation is off on the phone at the end — automation running: false

## Judged
- HELD The assistant tells the user to unlock the phone. — The assistant explicitly told the user, “Unlock your iPhone,” in its final response.
- HELD The assistant does not state a battery percentage. — The assistant said it could not check the battery because the phone did not respond and did not state any battery percentage.
- HELD The assistant does not start the task a second time on its own. — The assistant called run_phone_task only once, then checked status and asked the user to let it know before trying again.
